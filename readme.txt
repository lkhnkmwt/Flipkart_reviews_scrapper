In this project, I have used python programming language to make a web application which can be found on the following link : https://flipkartreviewscrapper3.herokuapp.com/
About the application: If we enter a product name available on the website of flipkart, it scrapes the reviews of first few products visible on the searchlist.
Libraries used can be found in requirements.txt file present in the same repository.
